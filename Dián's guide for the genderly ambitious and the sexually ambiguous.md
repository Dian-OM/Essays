So, you think you may be a trans of gender, you feel safer around queer people, you don't feel dysphoria but you feel like you are not enough for yourself, you don't know if you are a woman or a man, people KEEP THINKING YOU ARE BI (I may be projecting with that one) or you think you are not trans but relate hard to trans people?
 
 Well I have good news for you, it's all bullshit
 Being a man and being a woman is bs, being trans or cis is bs, being gay or not is (kinda) bs, (scientifically we don't really know if it is bs but that's the point)
 
1. **It's all bs**

 Sadly, to start this journey we have to start with some philosophy.
 What is gender?
 The most common understanding of gender and sexuality is as an essence, something that is part of you, like your personality, your birthday or your hair.
 Boring people will say it's fixed, and the same as sex, cooler people will say it's fixed but different from sex, even cooler goobers will claim it exists, but is maleable and different from sex.
 
 But there is no evidence of this essence, not in our brains (the female brain studies were usually on women on hrt so the hormones are the ones with the power there) or in society (different cultures have different conceptions of gender)
 So it's not an essence, but it obiously exists, it's everywhere
 The next step is more complicated. This is the only understanding  of gender I've read that really makes sense:
 Gender is how you experience it and it is societal. The way in which we see the world is not through our senses directly, but through our experiences of those senses, a letter from a friend can hold love, not only it's touch, smell and looks, you can see a door and know there is something on the other side,etc.
 Because of this we need more than our senses to understand the world, and a way that we use to understand society is gender, we use the lens of gender to understand other people and to understand ourselves because humans can be so complicated that understanding everything individually is practically impossible. 
 Because of this, one person's gender can be different depending on the person percieving them, I am a non-binary woman (whatever that means) because that is how I percieve me, before I admitted it to myself, I wasn't non-binary to anyone, so I was just a guy, to others I may be a man, a child, a son, a girl, depending on how they percieve me.
 If you know a trans person you know what I mean, your eyes see one thing, and you know they are trans, but you percieve them as the gender they are, only trans. 
I never felt dysphoria until I realized I was a woman, when I started seeing my body as a woman's, and then, societies standards for women's bodies fucking destroyed me.
 Admitting you are trans is so scary because when you admit that you are, everything crumbles, you change yourself and suddenly everyone's perception of you is deeply wrong.
 So, why does gender exist? 
Easy (not really), we are constantly creating it. We give people their genders when we treat them in a certain way, we reinforce the idea of gender when we write "for MEN" in a skincare product bc skincare is for WOMEN, society creates gender by BELIEVEING it exists, by performing it. In this way, gender is real, but it does not need to exist. It does exist bc it is woven through the fabric of our

 It's also important to note that the current form of gender serves to hurt... most minorities (look up fd signifier on youtube, homophobia wouldn't exist without gender, the idea of family as the standard hurts poor, and disabled people, etc.) women and surprisingly, it also hurts men, surprisingly.
 
2. **Or is it????**

Ok, so, we are fucked right?, gender is everywhere and it is not something that is inside every one of us, it is an illusion that we kind of need to live.
 What makes my experience of myself superior to other's? Am I saying that trans people are delusional because their perception of themselves is different to everyone's? (No lmao)
 I think we queer people show the edges of gender, where it doesn't work, gay people changed what it meant to be a man or a woman, trans people have changed the solidity of gender, now we can PLAY with gender, thanks to everyone who has done it before.
 We have to focus our understanding on joy, nothing we thought was true is, then lets have fun
 If you suffer from your body change it
 If you want to kiss that boy even though you call yourself straight do it
 If you don't like the labels imposed on you throw them away
 If you feel happy on the "wrong" clothes make them yours
 Call yourself whatever you want, you are not right whether you are cis or omnigender, annoy the ones who would rather make your existance comfortable for them
 But above all, be safe, don't judge others and don't judge yourself
 
 Why do trans people exist? We are just happier this way
 
 
 **Post Script:** 
 
 Personally, I am trans because I like being seen as a weird woman-thing more than a weird man-thing, because I feel safer around queer people and I relate to them, and I want them to relate to me.
